Description: LADSPA plugins designed for Alsa Modular Synth
 MCP plugins implement a set of LADSPA plugins that vastly improve
 the sound of AlsaModularSynth.
 .
 Currently they consist of these plugins:
  * Moog VCF (1-3): Moog lowpass filters that quite successfully
    emulate the properties of the analogue circuit. Version 3 of
    these filters is recommended.
  * Phaser1: A phaser with up to 30 all-pass filters in series.
  * Phaser1+LFO: The same as above, but with built-in LFO. LFO
    waveform can be continuosly changed from saw down to triangle
    and saw up.
  * Chorus (1,2): Two chorus plugins.
